    Why You Should Switch To Linux</h1>
  <p>by <strong>Farhan</strong>...</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Now guys, before i tell you the answer, you gotta understand what Linux <strong>IS</strong>. So stay tuned (or just scroll down) to find out why you should switch!</p>
<br><br>
  <h2>What Is Linux?</h2>
  <p>Linux is a <strong>free and open-source</strong> family of operating systems that is <strong>resilient and
      flexible</strong>. The system's <strong>source code is accessible to everyone for anyone to look at and change,
      making it cool that anyone can see how the system works</strong>. People from all across the world are urged to
    work together and keep developing Linux due to its <strong>openness</strong>.</p>
  <p>Since the beginning, Linux has grown into <strong>dependable and safe</strong> distros that are used in an array of
    gadgets, including PCs, phones, and huge supercomputers. Linux is cost-effective because it's free and lightweight,
    helping older machines stay functional longer.</p>

  <h2>Distros</h2>
  <p>You might be confused from what I meant by <em>distros</em>...</p>
  <p>A Linux distribution, often shortened to ‚Äúdistro,‚Äù is a packaged version of Linux that comes with the Linux kernel
    plus a collection of software and utilities that make the OS functional and user-friendly.</p>
  <p>Some distros are optimized for business, offering tools for productivity and enterprise management,
    while others focus on multimedia, bundling advanced audio and video editing software. Distributions 
    for software developers come preloaded with compilers, programming tools, and integrated 
    development environments (IDEs).</p>
  <p><strong>The 10 most common and used distros are:</strong></p>

      <li>Manjaro</li>

<h2>ANSWER TO MAIN QUESTION!</h2>
<p>SO GUYS... there are <strong>many</strong> reasons on why you <strong>should switch to Linux</strong>.</p>
<p>It's <strong>Lightweight, Efficient and it can also be used for gaming pretty well these days</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Lightweight:</strong> These days... Windows puts in the biggest amount of bloat EVER... Like bro... does ANYONE remember the good old days when Windows use to be clean? Nowadays... Microsoft puts in SOOOO much bloat like flippin' CANDY CRUSH, LINKS TO RANDOM GARBAGE ONLINE.. PUTTING AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF ADS EVERYWHERE ON A PRODUCT YOU BOUGHT FOR OVER A HUNDRED BUCKS GUYS... A bunch of garbage NO ONE WANTS. All of this taking up GIGABYTES of storage on just a FRESH INSTALL of Windows! now guys... i could go ranting about this for a LONG time.. but i wanna continue with my other reasons aswell...</p>
<p><strong>Efficient:</strong> Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is highly optimized, meaning it can run smoothly even on older hardware. Many Linux distributions (distros) use fewer system resources, allowing for faster performance. Now Linux is also <strong>Modular</strong> meaning that YOU can strip of <strong>unwanted background services</strong> Linux just has NO preloaded garbage like Windows does. This makes Linux <strong>more efficient, clean and faster</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Gaming:</strong>... now you guys might be laughing right now... but hear me out... Linux has come a long way in the gaming industry. These days... you can play almost ANY game on Linux thanks to companys like Steam and GOG that have pushed for Linux support.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Now guys... Linux has come very far and today and very famous and influential people like Pewdiepie have completly switched; telling others that Linux can do almost all things like Windows and MacOS these days.</p>
<br></br>
<p>So guys, I hope you've learnt a lesson today and maybe thought about actually switching! <STRONG>BYE!</STRONG><img src="vids/linuxlogoanim.gif"> 26/05/2025</p>
